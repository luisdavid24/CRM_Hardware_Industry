# CRM_Hardware_Industry

Hardware industry CRM repository.

The hardware distribution company CRM (Manage Customer Relationships) in this case called JDAS is designed for the easy manipulation and organization of internal information, for example customers contacts, sales and products registers, whit de possibility of generating statistical reports, all this managed for registered users in the system.

The users who wish to use our system should login in the initial page whit the credentials, if the user doesn't have de credentials, can do the registration, then, the user go to homepage where he can see a welcome message and a sidebar whit the icons for the pages navigation, all whit a intuitive and easy understand interface.

For development we used HTML for pages structure, javascript, css and boostrap framework for graphic interface, all this for frontend. For the backend we used the model view controller in Java language using Neatbens how IDE, and we used SpringBoot framework; for the database we used a local relational DB in phpMyAdmin.
